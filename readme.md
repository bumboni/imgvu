## about
imgvu is a reliable fast open source cross platform image viewer written by bumbread. This image viewer is oriented towards speed in both the program's speed and the speed at which the user is able to interface with the program. One of the key features is that you _don't need to use your mouse_ while using this program.

this is a small educational project which I started for two reasons.
* I need practice programming and exploring new things, which I can achieve learning different image formats and ways to parse them.
* I'm fucking tired of windows' image viewer being black screen for several seconds and then turns out that you actually need to restart it, and even then it loads several seconds.

## notice:
by *fast* I mean that a user doesn't get noticeable delay when using the program.
by *reliable* I mean that if a certain kind of unexpected input is met, the program will be able to handle it smoothly. No crashes. No error messages (too far?? maybe i should print a warning line just in case..). 
by *cross platform* I mean that this program is ready to be ported to any other platform if someone dares to write a platform layer for another OS.
